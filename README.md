# Air Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) using urban pollutant data (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, CO, SO₂, O₃) with machine learning techniques.

## 📌 Overview
- Conducted extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand pollutant impact.
- Built and compared models including Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor.
- Achieved ~99% accuracy using Decision Tree Regressor.
- Dataset sourced from Kaggle, OpenAQ, and EPA air quality data.

## 📊 Techniques Used
- Missing value imputation
- Correlation analysis
- Feature selection
- Model evaluation (MAE, RMSE, R²)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📍 Future Work
- Integrate weather data for enhanced predictions
- Try ensemble models like Random Forest and XGBoost
- Build a real-time dashboard using Streamlit or Django
